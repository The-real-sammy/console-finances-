JS console log - Data input and output practice.

## Description Tutorials: xxxxx replace  xxxxx

This project looks at refactoring the HTML and CSS of an existing website. This is to both tidy up the code but to also review non-semantic elements; then reviewing how this can be altered to use the correct semantic elements to help the structure of a website without altering the existing content and style of website. 

The motivation to build this project is to help gain a better understanding of how to restructure code without affecting the exisiting output of a website and to use best practice when writing code. Having the correct semantic elements makes a website more accessible (eg: for screen readers etc.). This in turn increases and diversifies the users. 

### Refactoring this code has allowed the following learning outcomes:Tutorials: xxxxx replace  xxxxx

- The difference between non-semantic and semantic elements and how this affects the structure and accessibility of a webpage.
- The difference between class and id attributes and the different selectors for both within CSS.
- How to use parent and child tags and where to appropriately place class and id attributes, within the wrapped element and sub-elements, to get a clean and efficient code without repetition.
- How to arrange headings in a sequential order, with the most important headings to least important.
- How the title within the meta data affects the seo of the webpage.
- How to inactivate code using /* inactive */ within a html so you do not have to delete it while testing code and how to use the same method to create notes within the files.
- The benefits of using alt tags, both for accessibility, and as a descriptive element when an image does not load.
